# Minecraft Locator Bar "Video Player"

Some python codes and a data pack for "playing" videos on the Locator Bar in Minecraft

## How it works

- Use `convert.py` to generate a json file with the tile colors of your video.
- Use `create_frames.py` to generate the commands for the datapack (be carefull those files can get big)
- Copy movie_player into your datapack folder then use `movie_player:init` to restart it and `movie_player:next_line` to start playing

## Why did you do this?

It was fun.

## Any examples?
